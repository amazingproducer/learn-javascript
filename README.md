I'm following a set of challenge-based instructional sets from another party's repository. I've omitted the original README files because they include instructions which are not relevant to my regimen. Within each assignments directory of this repository, there are a number of JavaScript files with commented challenges to complete.

I'll attempt each challenge, committing my progress as I go, for future reference.
